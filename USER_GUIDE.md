# Grid Expand - User Guide

Welcome to Grid Expand, your digital assistant for creating grid-based drawings from reference images. This guide will walk you through how to use the application effectively.

## What is Grid Drawing?

Grid drawing is a technique used by artists to accurately transfer an image to paper or canvas. By dividing both the reference image and the drawing surface into a grid of equal squares, you can focus on drawing one square at a time, which makes it easier to capture proportions and details accurately.

## Getting Started

1. Open Grid Expand in your web browser.
2. You'll start at the project settings screen.

## Step 1: Configure Your Project

### Set Up Your Grid

1. **Square Size**: Use the slider to set the size of each grid square in inches. Smaller squares (0.5-1 inch) are better for detailed drawings, while larger squares (2-4 inches) work well for simpler drawings.

2. **Paper Dimensions**: Enter the width and height of your drawing paper in inches. Common sizes:
   - Standard drawing paper: 18×24 inches
   - A4 paper: 8.27×11.69 inches
   - A3 paper: 11.69×16.54 inches

3. **Project Title** (optional): Give your project a name.

4. **Notes** (optional): Add any notes about your project.

5. Click **Continue** to proceed.

## Step 2: Upload Your Reference Image

1. Click the upload area or drag and drop an image file.
2. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP.
3. For best results, use clear, high-contrast images.
4. Very large images will be automatically compressed.

## Step 3: Crop Your Image

1. Use the cropping tool to select the portion of the image you want to draw.
2. The crop area will maintain the same aspect ratio as your paper dimensions.
3. Drag the corners to resize the crop area.
4. Drag from the center to reposition the crop area.
5. Click **Crop Image** when you're satisfied.

## Step 4: Draw Using the Grid

### The Drawing Interface

2. **Mark Square as Complete**: When you've finished drawing a square, check the "Mark as complete" option. This helps you track your progress.

3. **Zoom Controls**: 
   - Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out.
   - Zooming helps you see fine details in specific areas.

4. **Rotation Controls**:
   - Use the rotation buttons to rotate the image if needed.
   - This can help with difficult angles or details.

5. **Fullscreen View**: Click on any square for a fullscreen detailed view.

6. **Print Grid**:
   - Click the "Print Grid" button in the top navigation bar.
   - A print options panel will appear with settings:
     - **Show completed squares**: Toggle whether to include highlighted completed squares in the printout.

   - Click "Advanced Options" to access additional grid appearance settings:
     - **Grid Line Thickness**: Adjust how thick or thin the grid lines appear (0.5-2px)
     - **Grid Line Opacity**: Control the transparency of grid lines (10-80%)
   - Click "Print Now" to generate a printable version with:
     - Customized grid lines for accurate transfer to your drawing paper
     - Optional reference labels to help track your progress
     - Your project title and notes (if provided)
   - A print dialog will open allowing you to select your printer and paper settings.
   - The printed grid can be used as a reference or directly as a template for tracing.

### Printing Tips

- **Paper Size**: Make sure to select the same paper size in your print dialog that you configured in the app settings.
- **Scale**: Select "Actual size" or "100%" in your print settings for accurate grid measurements.
- **Quality**: For detailed images, consider using a higher quality print setting.
- **Grid Appearance**: For the best results when transferring to paper:
  - Use thinner, fainter lines (30-40% opacity) if you plan to trace over the printout
  - Use slightly thicker, more visible lines (50-60% opacity) if you're using the printout as a reference
  - Hide labels if you prefer a cleaner look for your final drawing

## Saving and Loading Projects

### Saving Your Project

1. Click the **Save Project** button in the top right corner.
2. Your project will be saved as a JSON file to your device.
3. This file contains your project settings, image, and progress.

### Loading a Saved Project

1. Click the **Load Project** button in the top right corner.
2. Select your saved project file (.json).
3. The application will restore your project with all settings and progress.

## Tips for Effective Grid Drawing

1. **Work Systematically**: Complete one square at a time, moving from left to right or top to bottom.

2. **Start with Outlines**: Begin by drawing the major outlines and shapes in each square before adding details.

3. **Use Letters and Numbers**: Consider labeling your paper grid with letters and numbers (A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.) to easily match with the digital grid.

4. **Focus on Relationships**: Pay attention to how lines and shapes relate to the grid lines and to each other within each square.

5. **Regular Breaks**: Take breaks to rest your eyes. The progress tracking will help you pick up where you left off.

6. **Light Grid Lines**: On your physical paper, draw grid lines lightly so they can be erased later or will be barely visible in the final drawing.

## Troubleshooting

### Image Won't Upload

- Ensure the file is a supported format (JPG, PNG, WebP).
- Check that the file size is not too large (ideally under 10MB).
- Try a different browser if you continue to have issues.

### Project Won't Save

- Check that you have enough storage space on your device.
- Try using a private/incognito browser window if you suspect browser extensions are causing issues.

### Project Won't Load

- Ensure you're selecting a valid project file that was saved from Grid Expand.
- Check that the file hasn't been corrupted or modified outside the application.

### Performance Issues

- Close other browser tabs and applications to free up memory.
- Try using a smaller or more compressed reference image.
- Reduce the square size or paper dimensions for very detailed or large projects.
